# DEEP Weather Forecast
People have been dealing with weather forecasting since the dawn of time. Along with the development of technology, more and more effective meteorological methods were created, allowing more accurate estimation of the state of the atmosphere in the future. Currently, in consequence  to the dynamic development of computing power, methods using machine learning and deep learning are becoming more and more popular.
This thesis contains development of deep learning model for providing short term weather forecast in the area of Ireland. At the beginning an in-depth analysis of the problem was made and existing solutions considered. Next, the data set requirements were defined and the one best suited to them was selected. In further stages, the architecture and model parameters were selected. Finally, profound tests and conclusions drawn during the project implementation are presented.
